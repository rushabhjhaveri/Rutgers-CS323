All the code (*.m) files for each algorithm are stored in the code folder. 

Within the testcases folder, there are two subfolders: 
- testcases: This folder contains five testcases for each algorithm written. 
- testcase_results: This folder contains the program outputs for each corresponding testcase in the testcases folder.
